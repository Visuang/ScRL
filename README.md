# ScRL: Shape-centered Representation Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification

This is the official repository for **ScRL**, a novel framework designed for **cross-day and night person retrieval** in **Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID)**.

ðŸš€ **Code Coming Soon!** The source code and pre-trained models will be released upon the acceptance of our paper.

## ðŸ”¥ Introduction
**ScRL** effectively integrates **shape and appearance features** to improve VI-ReID performance. It addresses the **modality variations** between visible and infrared images, ensuring **robust person retrieval** under different modalities.
